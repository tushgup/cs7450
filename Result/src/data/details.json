All Gilbertson & Page’s pet foods are developed and produced in-house at Welwyn.\r\nOver the course of time, the underlying principles that guide the business haven’t really changed and Gilbertson & Page remains wedded to the simplicity of crafting highly-nutritious pet feeds and staying close to customers.\r\nTwo things probably highlight the contrast with the big brands. Firstly, there’s very little in the way of advertising, with the Company preferring to attend and sponsor lots of national and local events (for example, Gilbertson & Page have been the International Sheep Dog Society’s principal sponsor for many years). Secondly, in its 140 year history, the production facilities have moved a grand total of … 6 miles!\r\nThat ‘local manufacturing’ approach is important. It has allowed skills to develop over many years and for Gilbertson and Page to establish a very strong relationship with suppliers. It also makes the Company one of a relatively small number of pet feeds suppliers that still manufactures its products in the UK. This notion of “we make our own” is something that pet owners and animal professionals increasingly value.\r\nOf course, the science behind animal feeds has advanced enormously over even the past 50 years and, today, Gilbertson & Page is probably best known for its ability to formulate foods, especially for dogs, that address energy, life-stage and health issues – and to offer these ranges at very competitive prices (remember that lack of advertising I mentioned).\r\nAs a mark of its innovation credentials, Gilbertson & Page launched their Valu-Mix dry dog food in 1975, almost single-handedly creating the market for dry feeds, and they’ve just built a new product testing and development lab!\r\nIf you’d like to know about the Company’s work and its customers, please ‘like’ this Facebook page or visit the blog at gilbertsonandpage.net. Alternatively, you can contact them direct.\r\n",

    "longDescription": "Open all day, every day, for over 30 years\n\nMany of our much loved ingredients were left behind in our distant memories when we arrived here in the UK. Longing for the food we left behind in the Indian region our journey to find routes to import these products started, and before long we opened our doors to the public in 80s.\n\n\nOur first store was launched in East London, at the heart of the Bangladeshi community. The hard working ethics of the Bangladeshi community meant we had to be open and available for business for long hours, every single day. We pride ourselves to have been open from 9am-9pm, 365 days a year, ever since the opening in the 80s.\n\n\nAlthough the 80s was a time of uncertainty and hardship, there came a glimmer of hope - Indian Restaurants were becoming increasingly popular and on its way to becoming the UK's largest ethnic business sector. Never forgetting why we started up, we continued to provide retail services, but then added a specialist department – WHOLESALE. We became the UK's first Bangladeshi owned cash and carry supplying caterers around the country, and now across Europe.\n\n\nToday, our presence in the ethnic cash and carry sector speaks for itself. There isn't a single reputable caterer that wouldn't know our name. Our retail departments have evolved. We have added to our products - We now provide non-ethnic general consumer goods at our stores, providing the best products and services, all at the best prices.\n\n\nThe 'Rahim Brothers' were amongst the first generation of Bangladeshis in UK. It was later handed over to the second generation of family members in the 80s. Today, a new generation is amongst us, the third generation – a generation of new ideas.\n\n\nWe are now 'Rahims'. Leaders in pioneering the UK's ethnic cash and carry sector; hundreds have followed suite.",

    "longDescription": "Toymail, the first company to create toys that let friends and family exchange voice messages with kids, has announced the release of its next generation of messaging toys, a quirky plush line called \"Talkies\". Kids can use the revolutionary toys to connect to any number of approved adults via the Toymail app, and to their friends’ Talkies, making it unnecessary to give young children a phone.\r\n\r\nSending voice messages with Toymail is simple – parents purchase a Talkie, connect to it via the Toymail app for IOS or Android, and invite friends and family members to exchange messages with their child. Kids can initiate messages directly from their Talkie toys, too. Parents use Toymail to build deeper bonds with their children throughout the day, without having to put them behind a screen. Toymail chose messaging as its first service because of the enormous untapped market — 95% of children under the age of 10 don’t have a phone (70% of parents feel it would be inappropriate for children that age). Yet, 71% of parents surveyed state that they want their children to stay connected with friends and family for social and security reasons.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, Toymail toys were cost prohibitive to make. The dramatic decrease in the cost of WIFI chips has enabled Toymail to build software services into the physical form factor of a toy. \"Over the past two years, we've tested and perfected this product and the app that powers it,\" say Hill and Nanda. \"We're beyond excited to bring it to the masses.\"",

    "longDescription": "The Carrefour Group: one of the world’s leading retailers\r\n\r\nIn 50 years, the Carrefour Group has become a world leader in the retail sector. The second largest retailer in the world and the largest in Europe, the Group now features four major grocery retail formats: hypermarkets, supermarkets, cash & carry and convenience stores. The Carrefour Group currently has over 9 900 company-owned and franchise stores.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn international retailer\r\n\r\nA pioneer in countries such as Brazil in 1975 and China in 1995, the Group now operates on three major markets: Europe, Latin America and Asia.\r\nWith a presence in more than 30 countries, it generates more than 55% of its sales outside France.\r\n\r\n\r\nA force in local economic development\r\n\r\nEverywhere it operates, the Carrefour Group demonstrates its commitment to local economic growth. Because retail involves people, it always gives priority to recruiting people who live locally, and to training its managers and staff on site.\r\n\r\nVery often, the Carrefour Group is the premier private employer in the countries in which it operates. This is obviously the case in France – where the group was founded – but it also holds true in countries such as Brazil, Argentina and Italy. At the same time, the Group gives priority to local supply chains. So 75% of all its food products come from local suppliers in the countries in which it operates.",

Existing reusable cups were too large to fit under the group heads of the espresso machine and were, at best, utilitarian in appearance.With no options available to resell, we saw the opportunity to design and make our own. KeepCup designed and manufactured the world’s first barista standard reusable cup.Our mission is to encourage the use of reusable cups. We do this with great products, but also by delivering a positive global campaign that strives to make a difference to how people think about convenience culture.  We want to create a global brand and to be one of the brands that kick started the demise of the disposable.",

    "longDescription": "In 1934, a modest local barber in Greenville, Michigan had a need and saw an opportunity. It was the middle of the Great Depression and groceries were scarce. In an effort to take care of the customers who visited his barbershop, Hendrik Meijer purchased $328.76 worth of merchandise on credit. Together with his 14-year-old son, Fred, they opened North Side Grocery.\r\nMeijer continued to look for ways to innovate and provide higher levels of service to his customers. He renamed his store Meijer's Grocery and began broadening his business through the use of newspaper ads and fancy metal shopping carts. As World War II raged, Hendrik pledged his company's support to the war effort, and just like the Arsenal of Democracy, women became a key part of the Meijer workforce, numbering nearly half of all team members.",

    "longDescription": "The 1970s saw sound equipment for live performance increase in power capability, but not in reliability or fidelity. In 1979, John and Helen Meyer established Meyer Sound to create and support high-quality products for sound reinforcement and recording, designed to meet the real challenges faced by audio practitioners. Today, the company’s history shows a track record of more than 30 years of innovation, quality, performance and support.\nMeyer Sound has more than 300 employees at its Berkeley, Calif., headquarters and satellite offices, including one of the largest engineering staffs (in proportion to company size) in the audio industry. International sales and support are supplied by more than half a dozen offices around the globe. The company works closely with professionals in all areas of sound reinforcement, gathering information on customers’ needs and providing the tools, training, technical support and information to enable the best experience possible for sound system users and audiences alike. Meyer Sound products are manufactured entirely at its Berkeley factory, where high technology is combined with hand craftwork. By performing core processes in house, the company is able to exercise the control to insure its quality standards are met and that each unit is exactly the same as the last.",

    "longDescription": "Goddess Garden is a certified organic skincare company, created by a mom for her daughter, whose skin reacted poorly to conventional sunscreens and body products. The company began out of necessity. Nova Covington began making all her family’s skincare in her kitchen, using all-natural, pure botanical ingredients that were effective and safe for her baby daughter. She felt if her family needed clean products, other families did as well. Together with her husband, Paul, Goddess Garden was created. \r\n\r\nToday, Nova, Paul and the entire Goddess Garden team, make products that are certified organic and free from harsh chemicals that can cause skin reactions, hormone disruption and contribute to the destruction of the reefs. Goddess Garden, at its core, is a family. They have a parent-like commitment to care for their customers and the planet. Behind every decision they make are a set of guiding core values that ensure their business leaves a minimal footprint, and a positive impact. And they always keep in mind the best interests of their customers, their employees, their communities and the planet!\r\n\r\nGoddess Garden is most commonly known for its organic, reef-safe, non-nano sunscreen, but they also offer a complete line of certified organic skin care and essential oils. Plus, all products are made onsite in Boulder County, Colorado, and feature recyclable packaging.",

    "longDescription": "The Dash consists of a pair of discrete and completely wireless stereo earphones.They will playback music through a Bluetooth connection or use the embedded 4GB/1000 song music player. Everything about the design is focused on delivering freedom of movement, incredible sound and comfort. The Dash is awesome for sports and great for everything else.\r\n\r\nThe Dash works in sympathy with the wearer. Movements like pace, steps, cadence and distance are tracked. Heart rate, oxygen saturation and energy spent are measured, all the while real time acoustic feedback is provided. It even works without an attached smartphone.\r\n\r\nSafety and the ability to communicate with others are important. In addition to being earphones, the Dash will double as a Bluetooth Headset delivering clear voice quality through the embedded ear bone microphone. The ear bone microphone is not sensitive to background noise, since it picks up mechanical vibration generated by your voice from the ear bone.\r\n\r\nEven though The Dash provides impressive noise isolation, the wearer can choose to channel ambient sound into the headphone with the transparent audio feature. A swipe on the capacitive touch surface of The Dash will enable or disable ambient sound to pass through.",

When Thomas' search for a lifelike artificial Christmas tree came up empty-handed, the company was born to develop the most realistic and luxurious artificial trees. To accomplish this Balsam Hill designers craft trees to mimic nature using site visits and cuttings from live trees as their guides. The company opened for business online in October of 2006 by offering three collections. In 2007, Balsam Hill’s 7.5-foot Balsam Fir was named “Best Overall” artificial Christmas tree by Good Housekeeping Research Institute. Overall, Balsam Hill Reviews are positive, especially for their lifelike artificial trees. Balsam Hill is owned by Balsam Brands which earned revenues of $34.7 million in 2012. They have opened a showroom in Burlingame California.",

    "longDescription": "Once upon a time, two best friends named Jonny and Dan were looking for the perfect gift for a friend’s new-born. They wanted to give a unique present that was personal and wouldn't break the bank - but they could not find the perfect one. After many hours of research and trialling, they created their very first pair of personalised baby shoes. Soon the shoes were being requested by friends and relatives everywhere, and My 1st Years was born. Since then, My 1st years has been dedicated to creating high-quality personalised gifts, all made with as much love, as that very first pair of shoes. With next day delivery available and the brand’s iconic luxury gift box free with orders, it really is the online destination for gifts loved by all.",

So with a bit of pluck, a dash of determination and an ounce of ingenuity, they decided to make it themselves!",

    "longDescription": "We make wi-fi enabled smart thermostats for residential and commercial applications that are intuitive to use and beautiful to look at. We help you maximize comfort and savings without compromising your lifestyle.Before founding ecobee in 2007, Stuart Lombard was on a mission to reduce his family’s carbon footprint and save money. He found a lot of ways to conserve energy but most were complex and costly. However, he discovered that heating and cooling made up the majority of his home energy use. So, he tried a programmable thermostat. It turned out to be really complicated, even for someone with an engineering degree. And, unreliable. When Stuart and his family came home one winter day to find their house freezing, they'd had enough. He knew there had to be a better way and decided to build his own thermostat. A truly smart thermostat, that was easy to install, smart enough to deliver comfort, conserving energy and pay for itself in energy savings. That day, ecobee was born.",

The canning jar already makes an awesome platform for a travel mug: it’s easy to clean, made of heat-resistant glass, cheap, durable, and when sealed it doesn’t leak. The only problem is that with their large openings, canning jars are not great for spill-free sipping while on the move. So we adapted it - made a new lid that lets us drink like a boss from virtually any wide or regular mouth sized canning jar. It’s a simple eco-friendly alternative to poor-performing and messy disposable hot cups, and over-built and expensive travel mugs.",

As they packed school lunches, they knew the plastic baggies, drink cartons and single-use containers leaving their homes were destined for landfill. With this in mind, they created a waste-free lunch kit, and in 2008 U Konserve was born. The desire was to have an impact beyond just creating durable, long-lasting products. The goal was to offer reusable and innovative solutions to change behavior and help the planet. That is the same goal that drives our mission today.",

You can leave your hammock outdoors all season without worrying about rain or sunshine damaging it! (We call that a \"lazy-proof\" hammock). \n\nOur hammocks have been featured by Elle Decor, Architectural Digest, Vogue, Coastal Living and Sunset magazine. We have partnered with brands like TOMS, Kate Spade and SXSW to spread hammock love around the globe! We have also been named a \"Best for the World\" B Corporation! \n\nThe motivation behind our company is simple: by creating and selling the most awesome hammocks on earth, we create sustainable weaving jobs in marginalized communities. We empower mothers to lift their families from extreme poverty to the middle class and change their trajectory to build a brighter future. We believe that job creation is an important key to ending global poverty and operate on the philosophy that a \"hand up\" makes a bigger difference than a handout.\n\nJoin the hammock nation and \"Do Good. Relax.\" with us!",

The team discovered that nothing was available in the U.S. that compared to these UPF-rated fashion \"finds\" from Australia. Carter and Shore began importing small quantities, quickly realized their potential, and launched Wallaroo Hat Company.",

    "longDescription": "As the first herbal personal care and supplement line specifically designed for pregnant and breastfeeding women, Motherlove has led the holistic body care industry since its conception in 1990. Our dedication to consistent quality means crafting only the finest, purest products, and using certified organic ingredients designed to nurture, soothe and heal women on their all-important journey of nurturing life. Each of our formulas are time proven and backed with integrity, wisdom and an intimate knowledge of herbal remedies. \n\n Committed to our customers and setting a better-business example, Motherlove follows the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) set forth by the AHPA and the FDA. To ensure the utmost quality and consumer protection, we retain samples from every batch and have a computerized tracking system to follow any bottle sold. Our herbal supplements are made in an FDA registered, GMP certified facility. Before we place an order for an ingredient we receive a certificate of analysis and a sample. The certificate of analysis from the supplier shows test results for coliforms, salmonella, yeast & mold, bacterial plate count, heavy metals and pesticide residue. Herb samples are evaluated for color, smell and strength before approval. The finished product is then tested by an independent lab for bacteria, coliforms and heavy metals. Along with certificates of analysis for each ingredient and each lot number, we also have on file the certified organic, kosher and certified cruelty free documentation for our products. \n\n As a major supporter of organic farming and sustainable practices, Motherlove strives to do not only do what's best for mothers and babies, but what's best for the environment as well. All our office supplies and packaging is made from recycled materials (as is all company literature), we manufacture using wind credits, and of course, none of our products are ever tested on animals and are completely cruelty free. \n\n We also believe in supporting the social environment with our Nurturing Life Foundation, which promotes breastfeeding and supports mothers-in-need nationwide. Over 10% of all Motherlove Herbal Company's profits are donated to organizations that truly help nurture life, like The Maternal Wellness Center, Realities for Children and The Mountain Park Environmental Center. \n",

Home goods could be beautifully designed, functionally innovative and responsibly produced. From dish brushes to compost collectors and water bottles, Full Circle creates products that inform and inspire better choices.In 2013, a new brand, Creo, was hatched from the founders’ love of food and cooking. We believe the kitchen is a canvas and our creations, a work of art to share with our closest friends and family.  Creo products are for those who have elevated their enjoyment of food to an art form.  Our products are designed to inspire creative expression, from food preparation to presentation.  As always they are well designed, responsibly made and beautifully functional.  ",

    "longDescription": "Good Cloth specializes in ethical fashion—clothing, accessories, and home goods—that are designed with consideration for workers, the planet, and consumers. The shop curates products that are made with ethically-sourced materials and have a transparent supply chain. Style, workers' rights, and the environment are the heart of Good Cloth. The company includes product journeys for each item, so that consumers can read how products are made, from beginning to end. How clothing is made shouldn't be a mystery.The goal at Good Cloth is to give a product's entire journey so that the consumer can decide for himself/herself if it fits his/her ethos. The bar at Good Cloth is that each item is made (throughout it's supply chain) in a way that is fair to workers and to the environment. Each item must be high quality, because it isn't sustainable if it falls apart. Good Cloth also creates preferred shopping categorizes to make it easier for customers to shop by their own personal ethics—such as vegan, organic, shop local New Orleans (Good Cloth's headquarters is in New Orleans), Trade Not Aid, handcrafted, and made in the United States. Customers can also shop by cost (low to high, high to low). Good Cloth wants to ensure that all consumers have access to ethically made products. ",

The benefit corporation structure allows All Across Africa to focus on its mission of fighting poverty and restoring hope to the poor and marginalized in East Africa by providing economic opportunity through growing and expanding markets in the West. We truly believe that job creation and education improve people’s lives and allow for sustained economic growth.\r\n\r\nWe focus on training and equipping the rural poor with the capabilities necessary to benefit from the opportunity of participating in local and global markets. Our efforts go beyond simple vocational training and extend into personal finance, health and reconciliation. The artisans we work with are widows, rural weavers, genocide perpetrators and survivors, orphans, street children, and rural farmers.\r\n\r\nWe currently work with more than 3000 weavers on a regular basis. Each basket made and sold means food and medicine, education, community, and security for our weavers— and each basket means new life.\r\n\r\nGovernments and corporations can execute vast projects, but individuals have a unique power and privilege to impact other individuals on a personal level. Our organization exists for the resilient people of Rwanda, Uganda and other African countries and thrives because of the partnerships with individuals like you who support these women, men and their families.",

    "longDescription": "Solving challenges is the very foundation of who we are. After all, in the beginning, our founder, sea captain Robert Fergusson, didn’t particularly care about paint. He just wanted to keep his ship intact. That’s why, when he noticed that an accidental splash of fish oil had stopped the relentless spread of corrosion on his rusty metal deck, he immediately recognized it for what it was: A valuable solution. \n\nThe same passion that drove the Captain to spend his next few years creating the world’s first rust-preventative paint still drives us today. When we see a problem, we work diligently until we've perfected a solution—which has led to some of the most cutting-edge, durable and innovative products in the industry.",

At that time the company had two \"agencies\", one operating in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the other in Medan, Indonesia.\r\n\r\nThe company gradually developed into a diversified agro-industrial group with processing and shipping facilities in Asia and Oceania, Africa and South America, and with the management of important plantations of traditional crops like rubber, palm oil and tea.\r\n\r\nAs from 1970 other crops such as bananas, pineapples, ornamental plants, guava and pepper were introduced and the group also invested in real estate in Belgium and the United States of America, but this activity has been phased out.\r\n\r\nAn insurance business, originating from our involvement in commodities and their shipping, has been extended and now includes a wide range of insurance services.\r\n\r\nIn de last decade Sipef has been concentrating its agro-industrial activities exclusively on the production of palm oil, rubber, tea and bananas in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Ivory Coast. These own products are marketed by the group worldwide. In addition Sipef provides management and marketing services for third parties. Currently the estates extend to some 67 989 planted hectares.",

    "longDescription": "Founded in 2005, Ecologic Designs was conceived in order to offer a progressive solution for product design and manufacturing. As a design consultant working in the consumer housewares, luggage and appliance markets, Founder & CEO Davidson Lewis had a unique window into traditional product life-cycles and the manufacturing process. In his experience, there seemed to be a general disregard for real, comprehensive life-cycle assessments in these industries. Consumer products were being designed, manufactured and then discarded at an alarming rate. Over time he developed a moral concern for conventional manufacturing practices. Determined to provide positive contributions to the design and manufacturing worlds, he established the Ecologic Designs brand to focus on designing and manufacturing products as environmentally friendly as possible. ",

Our strategy is to be ahead of the wave, to take calculated risks on emerging business models well before the market has caught the wave.
